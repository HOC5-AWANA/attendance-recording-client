# Attendance Client (Python) - AWANA@HOC5
Preinstalled on laptops. Client used to check attendees in before the start of the program. Information entered will be passed to the backend API.

Setup:
 - Check to make sure the `requests` module is already installed. If not, use `pip install requests`.
 - Manually change `API_BASE_URL`, `API_AUTH_USERNAME`, and `API_AUTH_PASSWORD` in `utils/api.py` before starting with `python main.py`.

Note: this code was only tested on Python 2.7
